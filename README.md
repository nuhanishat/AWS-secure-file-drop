# Secure File Drop (AWS S3 + EC2 + Presigned URLs)

A minimal, production‚Äëready pattern for receiving and sharing files on AWS without creating extra IAM users or making a bucket public.

**What you get**
- Private **S3** bucket with **versioning + encryption**
- Lightweight **EC2** ‚Äúingress box‚Äù with an **instance role** (no static keys)
- Two helper commands to mint short‚Äëlived links:
  - `filedrop-presign-put` ‚Üí temporary **upload** (PUT) URL
  - `filedrop-presign-get` ‚Üí temporary **download** (GET) URL

> This README includes **ready‚Äëto‚Äërun examples** wired to the demo bucket: `nuha-secure-file-drop-v1` in **us-east-2**.

## üìê Architecture (at a glance)
```
[External user]
    |  (PUT via presigned URL)
    v
Amazon S3 (private)  <‚Äî‚Äî  EC2 instance (has IAM role)
    ^                        |
    |  (GET via presigned)   | systemd timer syncs /opt/filedrop/uploads -> s3://<bucket>/uploads/
    |                        |
  Your browser/CLI       Helper scripts: filedrop-presign-{get,put}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- **Bucket:** `nuha-secure-file-drop-v1` (region **us-east-2**), versioning enabled, encryption SSE‚ÄëS3
- **EC2 instance** (Amazon Linux) with an attached role that allows **only** this bucket:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::nuha-secure-file-drop-v1" },
      { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["s3:PutObject","s3:GetObject"], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::nuha-secure-file-drop-v1/*" }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **User‚Äëdata** installed (this repo‚Äôs script) which drops in:
  - A sync service: mirrors `/opt/filedrop/uploads` ‚Üí `s3://<bucket>/uploads/`
  - Helpers: `filedrop-presign-get` and `filedrop-presign-put`
  - Config: `/etc/filedrop.conf`

**/etc/filedrop.conf** (key lines)
```bash
BUCKET="nuha-secure-file-drop-v1"
REGION="us-east-2"
PREFIX="uploads"
EXPIRES_DEFAULT=3600
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (with the demo bucket)
All commands run **on the EC2 instance**.

### 1) Generate an **upload** link (PUT)
Create a URL that lets someone upload a specific file **without AWS creds**:
```bash
# Allows a collaborator to upload to: s3://nuha-secure-file-drop-v1/uploads/incoming/newfile.bin
filedrop-presign-put incoming/<FILE_NAME.TYPE> 900   # 15-minute expiry
```
Share the printed URL with your collaborator. They upload from their machine:
```bash
curl -X PUT -T ./<FILE_NAME.TYPE> "<PASTE_URL_FROM_YOU>"
```

### 2) Verify the object exists
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://nuha-secure-file-drop-v1/uploads/incoming/ --region us-east-2
# or inspect metadata
aws s3api head-object --bucket nuha-secure-file-drop-v1 --key uploads/incoming/<FILE_NAME.TYPE> --region us-east-2
```

### 3) Generate a **download** link (GET)
```bash
filedrop-presign-get incoming/<FILE_NAME.TYPE> 600   # 10-minute expiry
# Open the printed URL in a browser to download
```

> üîë **Keys & paths**
> - The `PREFIX` is `uploads/` by default. When you presign for `incoming/<FILE_NAME.TYPE>`, the S3 key becomes `uploads/incoming/<FILE_NAME.TYPE>`.
> - The uploader‚Äôs **local filename** doesn‚Äôt affect the S3 key.

---

## üì¶ Alternative: Drop files on the instance, let it sync
Instead of sending a PUT URL, you can place files on EC2 and let the timer mirror them to S3.
```bash
echo "hello" > /opt/filedrop/uploads/hello.txt
# Force an immediate sync (timer also runs every 5 min)
sudo systemctl start filedrop-sync.service
```
Then share via a GET link:
```bash
filedrop-presign-get hello.txt 600
```

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è User Data

`user-data/user-data.sh` ‚Äî Bootstrap the EC2 instance with everything needed (Amazon Linux 2/2023)

---

## üß∞ Helper scripts (reference)
These are installed by user‚Äëdata:

**`filedrop-presign-get` (bash wrapper around `aws s3 presign` for GET)**

**`filedrop-presign-put` (Python + boto3, proper PUT presign, region‚Äëaware)**

> If you‚Äôre not using the provided user‚Äëdata, ensure **Python 3 + boto3** are installed on the instance: `sudo yum/dnf install python3 python3-pip && sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade boto3`.

---


## üîí Security Notes
- Bucket stays **private**; **Block Public Access** remains **ON**.
- Use **short expirations** (5‚Äì15 minutes) for presigned URLs; share via secure channels.
- IAM role is **least privilege** and scoped to this bucket only.
- Turn on **S3 server‚Äëside encryption** (SSE‚ÄëS3 is enabled by default in examples).
- (Optional) Add **lifecycle rules** to clean up non‚Äëcurrent versions.

---

## üí∏ Cost Overview
- **S3:** storage + request charges (+ versioning overhead);
- **EC2:** instance hours (use t3.micro/t4g.micro);
- **Data transfer:** egress on downloads via GET links.

---

## üêû Troubleshooting
- **`TemporaryRedirect` with an endpoint** ‚Üí regenerate the URL for the **bucket‚Äôs region** (`us-east-2`). Ensure `/etc/filedrop.conf` has `REGION="us-east-2"`.
- **`Unable to locate credentials` on EC2** ‚Üí no instance role attached or IMDS disabled. Attach the role; retry.
- **`AccessDenied`** ‚Üí role policy must include `s3:PutObject` / `s3:GetObject` on `nuha-secure-file-drop-v1/*` and `s3:ListBucket` on the bucket.
- **Not seeing files when using the sync path** ‚Üí start the sync once: `sudo systemctl start filedrop-sync.service`; check `/var/log/filedrop/sync.log`.
